# Welcome to the First MEU Aux Mod

This mod aims to make small patches and corrections to the First MEU's OPTRE 
based modpack to improve gameplay. It contains everything from new supply pods,
weapon compatible ammo changes, and vehicle upgrades to bug fixes and cosmetic
additions.

## Contributing

2. Install WINSE's PBO Manager, [http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=16369](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=16369)
3. Make any changes you want to, try to look at the rest of the mod to get a sense of the style guide, i.e newline curly braces etc. 
4. To load the mod for tests it must be done locally, create folder called `@first meu DevAuxMod` where you will store compiled pbos (generated by bat or via PBO Manager/etc)
5. Open Arma, make sure to load the latest, base mod list while testing, and select "Add Local Mod" in the mods tab of the launcher, and select the `@first meu DevAuxMod` folder that you'll need to make and store the compiled pbo within.
6. Make sure to unload the official Workshop version of the mod, and start the game.
7. Now test your added feature, make sure no errors related to your change appear, and that the intended functionality occurs.
8. Now simply commit and push your changes to your git fork, and submit a merge request, I'll look over your changes and either make suggestions or merge your request.
9. Thanks for the help!
